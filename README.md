It was necessary to create a web application that calculates statistical parameters for quotes from the exchange.
When you click on Â«StartÂ», you must connect to the quote emulator at the address of the websocket to get quotes online.
When you click on the Â«StatisticsÂ» button, it displays the following statistical values on the page: average, standard deviation, 
mode, median, the number of lost quotes, if any, and the calculation time. You can press the button as many times as you want to get new results for the current time.

<b>Development stages: ðŸ‘‡</b>

<ul>
    <li>I wrote a function similar to a calculator</li>
    <li>I converted the design into code , used SCSS and classes for this purpose</li>
</ul>

<i>You need to insert a link inside the websocket from where the data will be taken.</i>
